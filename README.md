  Hello world, I am Kenneth. I am a aspiring person looking to make a bigger mark in the creative/developing world. I have a huge passion in creating things, that includes producing music, being an artist in anyway that I can be, and now I am here wanting to add web design/developing to my repertoire. I look forward to working and learning from all of these brillant minds out here.
